# Git Stack - Improvement Ideas

## Interactive Features
- Add `git stack list` command with fzf-based visual selection
- Show branch details and commit messages in preview window
- Interactive stack visualization
- Fuzzy search through stacks and branches

## Smart Detection & Context
- Auto-detect when current branch is part of a stack
- Suggest relevant actions based on context
- Show visual representation of current stack structure
- Detect and warn about potential stack issues

## Stack Status & Overview
- Add `git stack status` command showing:
  - Current active stack
  - All branches in the stack with latest commits
  - Remote sync status for each branch
  - Conflict detection between stack branches
  - Stack depth and health metrics

## Advanced Stack Operations
- `git stack rebase` - Rebase entire stack onto main
- `git stack squash` - Combine all commits in a stack
- `git stack push` - Push all stack branches in order
- `git stack clean` - Remove merged branches from stack
- Undo/redo support for stack operations

## Documentation Improvements
- Rewrite README with clear use-cases
- Add visual examples of stack workflows
- Document common patterns and best practices
- Add troubleshooting section
- Include real-world examples
- Add architecture documentation

## Configuration & Customization
- Customizable branch naming patterns
- Configurable default base branch
- Maximum stack depth settings
- Branch name templates
- Custom stack naming conventions

## CI/CD Integration
- GitHub/GitLab PR creation for stack branches
- Auto-update PR descriptions with stack info
- Stack visualization in PR comments
- CI pipeline integration
- Automated stack health checks

## Safety Features
- Prevent accidental deletion of unpushed branches
- Warn about unmerged changes
- Backup option before destructive operations
- Stack state validation
- Conflict prevention mechanisms

## Future Ideas
- Visual stack representation in terminal
- Stack metrics and analytics
- Multi-remote support
- Stack sharing and collaboration features
- Integration with code review tools
